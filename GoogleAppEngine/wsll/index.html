    <p>Thank you for taking our survey.  Or more precisely thank you for coming to the first page in our survey.  I'm assuming you'll complete it since it's only four questions.  Seriously it'd be really lame if you didn't.  You aren't lame are you?</p>
    <p>We are attempting to come up with a name for our new company.  To do that we will show you four potential names.  Each name will be shown in the same branding context.  We would like you to vote 1 - 5 on each name based on how much you like or dislike the name.  If you have any comments about the name please add them as well.</p>

    <p>Thank you</p>
